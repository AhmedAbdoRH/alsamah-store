# Prerender.io integration with token-based authentication
# This configuration redirects crawlers to Prerender.io service
# Prerender.io will automatically detect crawlers based on User-Agent
# Format: from_path  to_url  status_code  headers
# The "!" forces the redirect even if the file exists
# Note: This redirects ALL requests to Prerender.io, which will handle crawler detection

# SPA routing - fallback for regular users
# Note: This rule may not be reached due to the Prerender rule above
# However, Prerender.io will handle non-crawler requests appropriately
